# Summary
This was the project that I worked on my senior year of high school. It solely used a game engine that I wrote 
(rendering was taken care of by libraries). It has four games and they can either be played with a controller or keyboard. I worked with somebody else to put the games in a wooden arcade cabinet that we built.

## Robowars: an endless platformer where the player is chased by a monster. There are powerups, enemies, and the player can jump in midair.

## Space Shooter: a space shooter that has some similarities to Galaga

## No Internet Game: game that is similar to Google's No Internet Dinosaur Game. I added a twist though (horizontal movement)!

## Bird Shooter: pong-like game where you have to shoot the ball multiple times to have it change direction

before running. The file that needs to be run is the game_runner.py file. Make sure you run it from the root directory!
