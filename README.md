First 3 years of programming

# Summary
This was the project that I worked on my senior year for school. It solely uses a game engine that I wrote 
(rendering was taken care of by libraries). It has four games and most of them can either be played with a controller or keyboard:
1. A Space Shooter that has some similarities to Galaga
2. A game that is almost an exact clone of Google's No Internet Dinosaur Game
3. A platformer that has multiple powerups and has some unique mechanics to make it different
4. A pong-like game where you have to shoot the ball multiple times to have it change direction

# How To Run
This project has multiple dependencies that need to be downloaded: pygame and game-qu. So type these commands in the terminal
before running. The file that needs to be run is the game_runner.py file. Make sure you run it from the root directory!
- pip install game-qu
- pip install pygame
