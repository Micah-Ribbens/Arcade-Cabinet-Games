This was the project that I worked on my senior year for school. It solely uses a game engine that I wrote 
(rendering was taken care of by libraries). It has four games and most of them can either be played with a controller or keyboard:
1. A Space Shooter that has some similarities to Galaga
2. A game that is almost an exact clone of Google's No Internet Dinosaur Game
3. A platformer that has multiple powerups and has some unique mechanics to make it different
4. A pong-like game where you have to shoot the ball multiple times to have it change direction
